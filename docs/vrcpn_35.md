## Improvements


* **Updated VRChat to [Unity 2019.4.31f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.31).** This upgrade is minor and includes an array of small bug fixes.
	+ This Unity update includes several fixes, including: "Graphics: Reduced main thread hitching caused by Shader loading". For VRChat, this means reduced hitching during avatar loading!
	+ ***Content that was uploaded with any Unity 2019 version we've supported previously does not need to be updated.***
	+ **Upgrading your project is very easy!** Install the new version via Unity Hub and open your 2019.4.29f1 or 2019.4.30f1 project in it. Done!
	+ Our documentation page for the [Currently Supported Unity Version](/docs/current-unity-version) will be updated upon release to Live. For now, go to [Unity's page for 2019.4.31f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.31) and click "Install this version with Unity Hub" right under the title.
